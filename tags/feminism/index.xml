She said some important things about stigma in society. She talked specifically about the stigma of not talking about birth control, but she made general statements too. It&amp;rsquo;s each person&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to work against stigma and stop the human tendency to cast out others. I need to spend more time thinking about my own stigmas and biases, so that I can help those who are marginalized.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
