&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When knowledge is new, it sometimes only comes back to me when I&amp;rsquo;m in the right context. For example, right now I can only think vaguely of how to adjust a chain derailleur on a bike, but I know that if I walked up to my bike and looked closely at the derailleur some more knowledge would appear. And we all have the familiar experience of being able to predict whether we&amp;rsquo;d recognize the name of a person or a song once it&amp;rsquo;s been said to us, but we can&amp;rsquo;t think of what it is until then.&lt;/li>
