I speak Spanish pretty well, which together with English gives me a strong base for comprehension.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>2021-08-01&lt;/strong>: I started using Duolingo every day, and got into the XP challenges to the point where I was getting like hundreds of points most days. I&amp;rsquo;ve currently (2022-06-01) got 15821 XP and 103 lesson crowns in the French course, and most of that came from Fall 2021. That really gave me a good sense for basic grammar and function words.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
