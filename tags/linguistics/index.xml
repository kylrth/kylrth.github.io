While the stories in the book leave me feeling like every language lost is a terrible cost, I think it&amp;rsquo;s inevitable as our species merges into a global society due to technology. I think we ought to prioritize the proper treatment and respect of marginalized and alternative cultures, including their languages and how these cultures want to maintain them. But there is a cost to stopping &lt;em>all&lt;/em> language loss that is just not worth it once a language has been documented for research purposes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
