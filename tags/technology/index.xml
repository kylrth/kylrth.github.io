(Click the title to download the preprint.) Our interest in the topic was initially piqued when we stumbled across the &lt;a href="https://wilfordwoodruffpapers.org/wilford-woodruff-ai-learning-experience">Wilford Woodruff AI Learning Experience&lt;/a>, and this paper explores the unique intersection of Mormonism, transhumanism, and machine learning that makes such a thing possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re currently looking for a venue to publish this work. &lt;strong>Any feedback on the preprint is appreciated!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Better, Nicer, Clearer, Fairer: a critical assessment of the movement for ethical artificial intelligence and machine learning</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/better-nicer-cleaner-fairer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Oct 2023 12:53:31 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/better-nicer-cleaner-fairer/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>I will present this paper in the FATE (fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics) reading group tomorrow (2023-10-25). You can view the slides I&amp;rsquo;ll use &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Bl4Bfh-ryFfmsEVrmdnYBe69hKjZP4mYZppvZHU5-yM/edit?usp=sharing">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are unresolved tensions in the algorithmic ethics world. Here are two examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Is inclusion always good?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gebru: &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t have ethical A.I. that&amp;rsquo;s not inclusive&amp;hellip; [a]nd whoever is creating the technology is setting the standards&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nelson: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; I struggle to understand why we want to make black communities more cognizant in facial recognition systems that are disproportionately used for surveillance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>academic activism
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>O&amp;rsquo;Neil: why is there a lack of academic efforts to inform policymakers and regulators?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PERVADE: Academics have been doing this work for a while but it is underfunded, marginalized, and at odds with a US political apparatus generally favorable towards Silicon Valley.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Ethics manifestos or value statements mask these tensions behind a business ethics lens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>thoughts on technology ownership</title><link>https://kylrth.com/post/tech-ownership/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 12:11:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/post/tech-ownership/</guid><description>&lt;p>Having heard about the &lt;a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/">terrible privacy policies of car manufacturers&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/3/23624328/ford-self-repossessing-car-patent-connected-car-nightmare">Ford&amp;rsquo;s new patent to automate vehicle repossession&lt;/a>, I was finally able to formulate some thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had brewing for a while about ownership in this world of ubiquitous computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the industrial revolution, humans could essentially understand what a thing did by looking at it, and ownership was about possession of the object. Now we don&amp;rsquo;t understand our tools, and so possession does not imply control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tools and weapons: the promise and peril of the digital age</title><link>https://kylrth.com/book/tools-and-weapons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 20:58:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/book/tools-and-weapons/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>I started taking notes later in the book. There were lots of good insights in the first half. Sorry!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Getting the internet to rural communities is a big deal for the rural economy. Just like electricity, it&amp;rsquo;s something that needs government support because there isn&amp;rsquo;t the economic incentive for ISPs to reach some of these locations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus on AI now is not just a fad, but a convergence of several trends that have made AI the next logical step: the increased computational resources, flexible access to compute through the cloud, etc.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
