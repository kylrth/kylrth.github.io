But the person who critiqued the book also has some weird ideas about sleep,&lt;span class="sidenote-number">&lt;small class="sidenote">For instance, he believes that we evolved in a sleep-deprived environment so sleep deprivation must be healthier for us.&lt;/small>&lt;/span>
so in the end I think I probably side with the sleep scientist for most issues except when he seems extreme. Isn&amp;rsquo;t epistemology fun?&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
