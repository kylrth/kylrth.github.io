&lt;li>An important question is how much we need to fight income inequality. Is it fair to have 35% growth in the upper class and 3% growth in the lower class? Where is a good balance?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have grown a lot richer since the Industrial Revolution, because we&amp;rsquo;ve become more productive.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Globalization is good because it allows us to buy cheaper, better products.
We can offset short-run job loss by paying or giving human capital to those who lose their jobs to globalization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Policies often don&amp;rsquo;t do what we intend them to do, because they change people&amp;rsquo;s decisions for the involved choice. Often, the best way to do policy is to incentivize the appropriate decision.
E.g. Tax the purchase of inefficient cars on a scale, so car makers want to produce cheaper efficient cars to compete.
Do that instead of simply banning cars with 18 mpg or less.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Fed&amp;rsquo;s job is to control the availability of credit through setting their interest rates, so banks who borrow from them can adjust their interest rates accordingly. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard with so many factors, but Bernanke et. al. did an outstanding job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Things that help an economy or nation develop:
effective government institutionsproperty rightsno excessive regulationhuman capitalgeography (countries between the tropics have more diseases and less productive crops)openness to traderesponsible fiscal and monetary policy(natural resources don&amp;rsquo;t matter)democracypeaceinclusion of women in economic production&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can help underdeveloped countries, but the question of how is complicated.
Certainly, we should open our borders to their products.Jeffrey Sachs &amp;ndash; all these countries need is capital, so developed countries should invest in them (e.g. through comprehensively fighting AIDS)William Easterly &amp;ndash; We can&amp;rsquo;t measure effectiveness based on inputs. That&amp;rsquo;s like rating Hollywood movies by budget size. &amp;ldquo;Instead we should do small, context-sensitive projects with measurable benefits.&amp;ldquo;But most of the developing world&amp;rsquo;s problems come from bad government policy.&lt;/li>
