## class goals

This class will be a mix of lecture and hands-on tutorial.
I'd recommend pulling out your laptops if you have them, so you can follow along.

The goal is that at the end of the class:

* You understand what .highlight1[Git] and .highlight1[GitHub] are.
* You understand .highlight1[why they are useful] and important for software development, including ML projects.
* You understand more details of .highlight1[how Git works].
* You understand common .highlight1[collaboration workflows].
* You know how to find more resources .highlight1[on your own].

--

This class will _not_ make you a Git expert.
There are too many tools and options to explore in two hours!

???

- I am aware that many of you are already familiar with Git, but the goal is to have everyone on the same page.

---

## What is Git?

Git is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (VCS).

--

_Version control_ is a class of systems to manage changes to software, websites, documents, etc.
Most version control systems allow you to do the following:

* Revert files to older versions.
* View how a certain file or function changed over time.
* Work on new features without touching the _official_ version.
* Collaborate with distributed teams.
* Have your files securely backed up.

--

Git, Subversion, and SVN are the most common versioning tools, but Git is by far the most popular.*

.references[*[93% adoption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Adoption) as of 2022 according to the StackOverflow developer survey]

## installing Git

There exist graphical user interfaces for Git, and you can use them if you like.
However, the .highlight1[command line] version is:

* common to all systems
* feature complete
* used by nearly all tutorials and discussion online
* probably the best way to learn

--

What is everyone's comfort level with the command line, not just for Git?

How many of you have used Visual Studio Code before?

## configuring Git

If this is the first time you are using Git, it is worth taking a few minutes to set up your Git environment.
The `git config` subcommand allows you to manage Git settings.

--

<br />
To view all your settings:

```bash
$ git config --list --show-origin
```

--

To set your name and email:

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Kyle Roth"
$ git config --global user.email kyle.roth@umontreal.ca
```

---

## configuring Git

If this is the first time you are using Git, it is worth taking a few minutes to set up your Git environment.
The `git config` subcommand allows you to manage Git settings.

<br />
Certain Git commands will open a text editor to take user input from you.
To set your preferred editor:

```bash
$ git config --global core.editor vim
```

(Or instead add `export VISUAL=/usr/bin/vim` to your `~/.bashrc` to set the default text editor system-wide.)

--

<br />
This guide has more details on configuration:

## How does Git work?

### a stream of snapshots (commits)

.context[Git thinks of its data like a series of snapshots of a file tree.]

.center[![:scale 60%](snapshots.png)]

.references[Source: Pro Git book, [1.3 Getting Started - What is Git?](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)]

--

When we start a software project, we usually store all the relevant code and documentation in a folder:

```txt
[kyle@computer repo]$ ls -a
.  ..  cmd  collect.go  go.mod  go.sum  Makefile  README.md  task.go
```

---

## How does Git work?

### a stream of snapshots (commits)

.context[Git thinks of its data like a series of snapshots of a file tree.]

.center[![:scale 60%](snapshots.png)]

Once you've initialized a repository, Git stores its data in the `.git/` subdirectory:

```txt
[kyle@computer repo]$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/kyle/repo/.git/
[kyle@computer repo]$ ls -a
.  ..  cmd  collect.go  .git  go.mod  go.sum  Makefile  README.md  task.go

```

---

## How does Git work?

### repositories

When we want to share code with others, we publish the `.git` directory, which contains the history (the series of commits) of the contents of your folder.

--

If multiple people contribute to a project, they all need to be able to pull from each other's repositories to include each other's code in their repository.

--

The repository on your computer is called the *local repository*, and a repository anywhere else is called a *remote repository*.

Most projects have a single central repository that is regarded as the "official" copy, and everyone pushes and pulls from that.

```sh
[kyle@computer repo]$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:kylrth/repo.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:kylrth/repo.git (push)
```

???

But Git was written with a more distributed workflow in mind, where people could push and pull from each other's repositories.

---

## What is GitHub?

GitHub, Inc.---now a subsidiary of Microsoft---is a company that hosts remote Git repositories on the internet.

They provide free hosting for open source projects, and offer paid subscriptions for individuals and organizations that want private repositories.

GitHub is extremely popular among software developers and computer scientists.

--

## terminology

### repository

On a computer, a repository is a directory (a folder) that has a `.git` subdirectory.

A bare repository (created with `git init --bare`) is just the `.git` folder (no working tree).

GitHub repositories are linked to URLs, and they can be _public_ or _private_.

???

Bare repositories usually end with .git, which is what you see on GitHub URLs.

--

### fork

A fork is a copy of a repository.
Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
.cite[[(read more)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)]

---

## GitHub repositories
### cloning a repository

_Cloning_ a repository means making a **local copy** of the repository on your machine.
Cloning downloads both the files and the Git history from a remote repository.

---

## Git in more detail
### the three states

In your local repository, Git has three main states that your files can be in:

* `modified`: you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
* `staged`: you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next **commit** snapshot.
* `committed`: the data is safely stored in your local database.

.references[Source: Pro Git book, [1.3 Getting Started - What is Git?](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)]

---

## basic workflow
### 1. `git status`

.context[the simplest use case, without collaborators]

`git status` tells us which files are in which state.
It is a good practice to run this command often, especially during the learning phase, to keep track of what is going on in your repository.

It may take you a while to understand all the information from `git status`, but you will usually find the information you need.

--

This is what you should see in a freshly cloned repository:

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

---

## basic workflow
### 2. work on your project

.context[the simplest use case, without collaborators]

After _modifying_ a file, `git status` will show something new and informative:

```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

## basic workflow
### 3. `git add`

.context[the simplest use case, without collaborators]

 _Adding_ a file means to _stage_ a change, in Git's vocabulary.
 Changes may be a modification to a file in the repository or _adding_ a new file to be tracked.
 It can be seen as a pre-step to _really_ saving the changes to the repository.
 This may sound complicated now, but [there are good reasons for it](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository).
 Add `README.md`:

```bash
$ git add README.md
```

--

Run `git status` again to see what changed.

```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
```

Now `README.md` is under _Changes to be committed_. What does that mean?

---

## basic workflow
### 4. `git commit`

.context[the simplest use case, without collaborators]

Now we could continue working, adding more changes, perhaps in other files, and eventually we would like to _commit_ our changes to the repository so that the version control can keep track of them.
.highlight1[_Committing_ changes means to save a snapshot of the current state of our repository], with a time stamp and all the necessary things that will allow us to go back to this point in the future, and many other important possible actions.
To commit our changes, we have to add a message describing the changes.

```bash
$ git commit
```

This opens a text editor where you can enter the message.
There's a shortcut as well if your message is short:

```bash
$ git commit -m "add name to list"
```

You may want to run `git status` again.

---

## basic workflow

### A good commit...

--

- contains a single semantic change
- includes any tests for that change
- passes all tests in the repo
- has a descriptive and detailed commit message

---

## basic workflow
### The life cycle of Git files

Files in a Git repository can be in one of these two stages:

* `tracked`: files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be `unmodified`, `modified`, or `staged`. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.
* `untracked`: any file that has never been added with `git add`.

As you edit, add, stage, commit, or remove files, they can be at different states:

.center[![:scale 45%](lifecycle.png)]

.references[Source: Pro Git book, [2.2 Git Basics - Recording Changes to the Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)]

---

## basic workflow
### 5. `git push`

.context[the simplest use case, without collaborators]

All we have done now has been local, meaning that we have not yet posted our changes online so that others or ourselves can access it.
We could continue working and adding and committing our changes, or we can _push_ the history of our changes now.
The default way of pushing is simply:

```bash
$ git push
```

You may be asked for your username and credentials at this point.

Now your new commits are online!

---

## Git collaboration flow
### pull requests (PRs)

PRs let you tell others about changes you have pushed to a **branch** in a repository on GitHub.
Typically, after a PR is open, someone else in the team will review the changes, discuss issues, and eventually merge the branches.

A good pull request

- contains a series of commits that are semantically distinct
- only contains code for a single feature
- can be reviewed in one sitting (ideally +1000 -1000 max)
- has a clear description

## branching

.context[So far, we have only worked within the `main` branch]

Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.
Branching in Git is a lightweight process and it is one of its main features.

--

.left-column-66[
.center[![:scale 90%](branch-and-history.png)]
]
.right-column-33[
* `HEAD` is a reference to the last commit in the current branch.
* `v1.0` and `main` are branches (which happen to have identical histories)
* `98ca9`, `34ac2` and `f30ab` are commits
]

---

## branching

.left-column[
To see your branches:

```bash
$ git branch
```

To create a new branch:

```bash
$ git branch kyle/feature-a
```

To switch branches:

```bash
$ git checkout kyle/feature-a
```

To create and switch branches:

```bash
$ git branch -b kyle/feature-a
```
]

--

.right-column[
To push a branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin kyle/feature-a
```

The `-u` means `--set-upstream`, so that Git knows what a simple `git push` means in the future.
]

???

It's a common convention to name branches by their owner.

## merge vs rebase

To merge branch `kyle/feature-a` into branch `main`:

```bash
$ git checkout main
$ git merge kyle/feature-a
```

To rebase:

```bash
$ git rebase kyle/feature-a
```

--

What if the changes conflict?

---

## merge vs rebase

### merge conflicts

Merging branches is sometimes a smooth action, but if two branches alter the same section of code often it's not clear how both changes should be applied.

```bash
$ git merge kyle/feature-a
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

To read more: [Pro Git: Basic Branching and Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)

???

TODO set up a good example to walk through resolving a merge conflict

---

## merge vs rebase

So which is better?

--

- Merge commits keep a separate record of the changes that were needed to combine the branches.
- Rebasing forces the author to take into account the latest updates on `main` when designing the series of commits in the pull request, resulting in a cleaner history.

---

## interactive rebase

```bash
git rebase -i
```

???

TODO set up a good example for this

---

## Git collaborative workflow
### in summary

1. Create a new branch to make your changes.
1. As you make changes, make some commits to improve the project.
1. Push your changes into your copy (fork) of the repository.
1. Open a pull request to merge your branch into another branch or into another repository.
1. Discuss, and optionally continue committing changes.
1. The project owner merges or closes the pull request.

## work in breakout rooms

Ideas to play around and gain expertise:

- Create your own repository.
- Create new branches in your repository, make changes and merge branches.
- Fork each other's repository and open pull requests, review and merge the changes.
- Add each other as collaborators of your repository
- Try to make conflicting changes across branches and resolve them.
- [Sync an upstream repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-from-the-command-line).
