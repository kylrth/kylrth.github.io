Simply doing fewer things is not meaningful. Most things in the world are trivial noise, and my job is to sift through noise and find things that are truly valuable. This involves active consideration of responsibilities and trade-offs involved in making a choice. I think I often try to &ldquo;force execution at the last moment&rdquo;, which is a mark of a non-essentialist.</p><p>I identify a little with the overly excited tech executive who felt interested in a million directions at once. It&rsquo;s important for me to discern the relatively few topics and efforts that really matter, and dedicate myself to them without external requirement.</p><p>One of the ways our world today is inherently different from that of 100 years ago is that a huge number of people have choices and have to manage themselves. It means that often I will have to say no to really good opportunities.</p><p>&ldquo;What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we had spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives?&rdquo;</p><h2 id=the-essence-of-essentialism>The essence of essentialism <a class=header-link href=#the-essence-of-essentialism><svg class="c-links__icon"><title>permalink</title><use xlink:href="#icon-permalink"/></svg></a></h2><h3 id=choice>Choice <a class=header-link href=#choice><svg class="c-links__icon"><title>permalink</title><use xlink:href="#icon-permalink"/></svg></a></h3><p>Essentialists recognize that choices are actions, not things.

During law school as the author pursued so many available choices &ldquo;the result was that while I was not entirely failing in any pursuit I was not entirely succeeding at any either.&rdquo; He had chosen to focus on too many things. I have felt the same way, especially during school.</p><p>The importance of opportunities or ways to spend time follows a power law distribution. Essentialists actually say no to many good opportunities.</p><p>I should say &ldquo;I want to &mldr;&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I have to &mldr;&rdquo; more often.</p><p>&ldquo;The top software developers are more productive than average software developers not by a factor of 10X or 100X or even 1,000X but by 10,000X.&rdquo; &ndash; Nathan Myhrvold, former CTO of Microsoft. I think top software developers (see citation in the next section) probably don&rsquo;t produce more code than those at the bottom. They probably produce less. This means part of their efficiency comes from the fact that they&rsquo;re coding the <em>right</em> things, because they take some time to think about it beforehand.</p><h3 id=trade-off>Trade-off <a class=header-link href=#trade-off><svg class="c-links__icon"><title>permalink</title><use xlink:href="#icon-permalink"/></svg></a></h3><p>When we choose to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to something, we are saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to several other things. To try to fit more things in than is possible is a straddled strategy (like the story of Continental Lite). You have to be <em>deliberate</em> with trade-offs: choose those things that you want to drop, in favor of a coherent strategy of choices.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to rank things that I value in order, so that when a conflict arises the value question is useful. Then when I approach trade-offs, I can say &ldquo;Which problem do I prefer to have?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;How can I do both?&rdquo;.</p><p>We should help our kids go after the things they care about most. I should trade other concerns for &ldquo;going big&rdquo; on a few things: family and church being the biggest.

But he couldn&rsquo;t kick the feeling that the career path he was on was just a close second to the path he should really be on. So he left academia and went to work with <em>National Geographic</em>. With that success came new and intriguing opportunities in Washington, D.C., that again left him feeling he was <em>close</em> to the right career path but not quite on it yet. As often happens to driven, ambitious people, his earlier success had distracted him from his clarity of purpose. Since the moment he had watched Jacques Cousteau aboard the famed <em>Calypso</em> he had dreamed of diving in the world&rsquo;s most beautiful oceans. So after a couple of years, when a golden opportunity presented itself, he changed gears again in order to be where he could truly make his highest contribution: as an explorer-in-residence with <em>National Geographic</em>, where he could spend a significant portion of his time diving in the most remote locations while also using his strengths in science and communications to influence policy on a global scale. The price of his dream job was saying no to the many good, even very good, parallel opportunities he encountered and waiting for the one he could enthusiastically say yes to. And the wait was worth it.</p></blockquote><p>How to decide where to take my career:</p><ul><li>What am I passionate about?</li><li>What am I good at?</li><li>What fulfills a need in the world?</li></ul><h2 id=elimination>Elimination <a class=header-link href=#elimination><svg class="c-links__icon"><title>permalink</title><use xlink:href="#icon-permalink"/></svg></a></h2><p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t own this, how much would I spend to buy it?&rdquo; is equivalent to &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t have this opportunity, what would I be willing to do to acquire it?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=clarify>Clarify <a class=header-link href=#clarify><svg class="c-links__icon"><title>permalink</title><use xlink:href="#icon-permalink"/></svg></a></h3><p>I need to be extremely clear about my purpose (goals) and strategy (plans). &ldquo;Sort of clear&rdquo; is not nearly good enough.</p><p>&ldquo;What will I say no to?&rdquo; means more than &ldquo;What will I say yes to?&rdquo; because it exposes your priorities.</p><p>Inspirational and concrete decisions eliminate thousands of others. For example &ldquo;I will seek a medical degree instead of a law degree&rdquo; means that over the next 5-10 years there will be a ton of small actions taken that lead toward that goal.

What is essential to me when I am pondering alone should be essential to me under the pressure of decision time.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to learn to say no respectfully and graciously, but directly.</p><p>When making the decision:</p><ul><li>separate the decision from the relationship</li><li>focus on the tradeoff</li><li>pause, even in person</li><li>&ldquo;no, but&rdquo; puts the burden of follow-up on them</li><li>&ldquo;yes; what should I deprioritize&rdquo; puts the burden of trade-offs on the superior</li></ul><h3 id=uncommit>Uncommit <a class=header-link href=#uncommit><svg class="c-links__icon"><title>permalink</title><use xlink:href="#icon-permalink"/></svg></a></h3><p>Sunk cost bias, yo.

What is the slowest-moving thing in my routine? What is getting in the way of real progress? There&rsquo;s often a single obstacle that, if removed, makes the whole project effortless. One example is an unnecessary desire for perfection in a prototype.</p><p>For example, the author&rsquo;s wife was stressed with taking care of the kids while he was at grad school. They realized that the primary cause was that she didn&rsquo;t have time to think and plan. He dropped some extracurriculars and they paid for a few hours of child care per week, and that made it possible for them to actually contribute <em>better</em> to their children, not worse.</p><h3 id=progress>Progress <a class=header-link href=#progress><svg class="c-links__icon"><title>permalink</title><use xlink:href="#icon-permalink"/></svg></a></h3><p>Every day, do something that makes real, small progress.</p><p>What is the minimal, viable amount of progress in this project that can really be valuable? For example, what is the first thing in my app project that I can accomplish that will really improve my skills and prepare me for grad school?</p><p>As you make progress, you learn what you need to make further progress. For example, it&rsquo;s important to get to a review stage as quickly as possible, because that review could invalidate work already done.</p><p>It can be important to simply <em>start</em> planning or thinking about something, so it can simmer.</p><h3 id=flow>Flow <a class=header-link href=#flow><svg class="c-links__icon"><title>permalink</title><use xlink:href="#icon-permalink"/></svg></a></h3><p>Routine makes a series of wins happen without tough decision-making.

Recognize what cues cause us to follow our habits, and use those cues to develop a habit of doing something else.</p><p>Do the hardest task first.
