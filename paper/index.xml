Our interest in the topic was initially piqued when we stumbled across the &lt;a href="https://wilfordwoodruffpapers.org/wilford-woodruff-ai-learning-experience">Wilford Woodruff AI Learning Experience&lt;/a>, and this paper explores the unique intersection of Mormonism, transhumanism, and machine learning that makes such a thing possible.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are unresolved tensions in the algorithmic ethics world. Here are two examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Is inclusion always good?
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gebru: &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t have ethical A.I. that&amp;rsquo;s not inclusive&amp;hellip; [a]nd whoever is creating the technology is setting the standards&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nelson: &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; I struggle to understand why we want to make black communities more cognizant in facial recognition systems that are disproportionately used for surveillance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>academic activism
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>O&amp;rsquo;Neil: why is there a lack of academic efforts to inform policymakers and regulators?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PERVADE: Academics have been doing this work for a while but it is underfunded, marginalized, and at odds with a US political apparatus generally favorable towards Silicon Valley.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Ethics manifestos or value statements mask these tensions behind a business ethics lens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>InstructEval: systematic evaluation of instruction selection methods</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/instructeval/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 11:38:24 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/instructeval/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This was a paper I presented about in Bang Liu&amp;rsquo;s research group meeting on 2023-09-25.

&lt;p>Behind each vision for ethically-aligned AI sits a deeper question. How are we to decide which principles or objectives to encode in AI—and who has the right to make these decisions—given that we live in a pluralistic world that is full of competing conceptions of value? Is there a way to think about AI value alignment that avoids a situation in which some people simply impose their views on others?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unsolved problems in ML safety</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/unsolved-problems-ml-safety/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 11:39:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/unsolved-problems-ml-safety/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This was a paper we presented about in Irina Rish&amp;rsquo;s neural scaling laws course (&lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/towards-agi-course">IFT6760A&lt;/a>) in winter 2023.

The main result of the paper is that when this is combined with item-specific prompt retrieval the performance drastically improves (&amp;gt;10% relative gain and lower performance variance). Interestingly, selective annotation does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> help for finetuning, or when the prompts are randomly selected. They call their selective annotation method &amp;ldquo;vote-&lt;code>\(k\)&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We observe that 48.2% [of] images [in ImageNet] are learned by all models regardless of their inductive bias; 14.3% [of] images are consistently misclassified by all models; only roughly a third (37.5%) of images are responsible for the differences between two models&amp;rsquo; decisions. We call this phenomenon dichotomous data difficulty (DDD).&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The authors varied hyperparameters, optimizers, architectures, supervision modes, and sampling methods, finding that models only varied in performance on about a third of the images in the dataset. And this isn&amp;rsquo;t specific to ImageNet; they found similar results for CIFAR-100 and a synthetic Gaussian dataset. They use this measure to divide the dataset into &amp;ldquo;trivials&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;impossibles&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;in-betweens&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond neural scaling laws: beating power law scaling via data pruning</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/beyond_nsl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 14:09:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/beyond_nsl/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this paper they show that we can achieve exponential performance scaling over dataset size, when the samples added are pruned to be only the best examples. This beats power law scaling in a big way. There is still no free lunch, in some sense, because in most cases it will become progressively harder to add new useful samples as the dataset gets bigger. But this is a big deal for computation, because it means that the number of samples in the dataset is not nearly as important as the coverage and quality that the dataset provides.&lt;span class="sidenote-number">&lt;small class="sidenote">This also means that scaling laws for &lt;em>compute&lt;/em> (usually expressed as a function of dataset and model size) are dataset-specific and not generalizable, because of how much sample quality affects data scaling.&lt;/small>&lt;/span>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LocoProp: enhancing backprop via local loss optimization</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/locoprop/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 09:52:06 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/locoprop/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This was a paper I presented about in Bang Liu&amp;rsquo;s research group meeting on 2022-08-05.

&lt;p>Continual-T0 (CT0) extends &lt;a href="https://kylrth.com/paper/t0/">T0&lt;/a> by progressively training it on 8 unseen language generation tasks, while retaining a replay buffer of 1% of the original training data to preserve performance. The result is a model that maintains nearly all of its performance on previous tasks while learning the new tasks. In addition, CT0 maintains the original T0&amp;rsquo;s performance on unseen tasks (which is a big deal because those tasks could not appear in the replay buffer) and it extends the compositionality of T0 to even more unseen tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multitask prompted training enables zero-shot task generalization (T0)</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/t0/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 17:05:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/t0/</guid><description>&lt;p>T0 builds on T5 by fine-tuning on more natural prompts and testing the model&amp;rsquo;s generalization to held-out tasks.&lt;/p>

Researchers did a better survey with more data and found that that was not the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The researchers cited 5 methodological improvements over the old research that suggested that it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter after $75,000:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>They measured people&amp;rsquo;s happiness in real time, instead of having people try to remember past happiness levels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They measured on a continuous scale instead of discrete. (The survey had a slider between &amp;ldquo;very bad&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;very good&amp;rdquo;, instead of discrete options to choose from.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They measured on &amp;ldquo;dozens of separate occasions per person&amp;rdquo; using an app, instead of just a single questionnaire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They used a comparable scale for experienced well-being (people’s evaluations of their lives) and evaluative well-being (how people feel during the day-to-day moments of their lives).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They included a large number of high-earning participants and measured higher incomes in more granular increments.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The data were collected from 33,391 employed adults (ages 18-65) in the United States.

The structure of the post follows the structure of the assignment: summarization followed by my own comments.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize, the authors create a unifying framework for describing message-passing neural networks, which they apply to the problem of predicting the structural properties of chemical compounds in the QM9 dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="paper-summarization">paper summarization &lt;a class="header-link" href="#paper-summarization">&lt;svg class="c-links__icon">&lt;title>permalink&lt;/title>&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-permalink">&lt;/use>&lt;/svg>&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The authors first demonstrate that many of the recent works applying neural nets to this problem can fit into a message-passing neural network (MPNN) framework. Under the MPNN framework, at each time step &lt;code>\(t\)&lt;/code> a message is computed for each vertex by summing the output of a learned function &lt;code>\(M_t\)&lt;/code> over the vertex and all edges and vertices connected to it. Then the next state for each vertex is a learned function &lt;code>\(U_t\)&lt;/code> of the previous state and the message. Finally, the &amp;ldquo;readout&amp;rdquo; function &lt;code>\(R\)&lt;/code> is applied to all the vertices to compute the result.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The effect of model size on worst-group generalization</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/effect-of-model-size-on-worst-group-generalization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 14:34:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/effect-of-model-size-on-worst-group-generalization/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This was a paper we presented about in Irina Rish&amp;rsquo;s neural scaling laws course (&lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nsl-course">IFT6167&lt;/a>) in winter 2022.

&lt;p>The interesting result is that the exponents of these three approaches were substantially different (see Table 1 in the paper), which says to me that the few-shot inference approach matters a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The surprising result was that while more training on the &amp;ldquo;non-natural&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot">Omniglot&lt;/a> dataset did not improve few-shot accuracy on other datasets, training on &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; datasets &lt;em>did&lt;/em> improve accuracy on few-shot Omniglot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning explanations that are hard to vary</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/learning-explanations-hard-to-vary/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:29:17 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/learning-explanations-hard-to-vary/</guid><description>&lt;p>The big idea here is to use the geometric mean instead of the arithmetic mean across samples in the batch when computing the gradient for SGD. This overcomes the situation where averaging produces optima that are not actually optimal for any individual samples, as demonstrated in their toy example below:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="example.png" alt="Learning explanations that are hard to vary example.png" class="img-zoomable">

&lt;p>In practice, the method the authors test is not exactly the geometric mean for numerical and performance reasons, but effectively accomplishes the same thing by avoiding optima that are &amp;ldquo;inconsistent&amp;rdquo; (meaning that gradients from relatively few samples actually point in that direction).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In search of robust measures of generalization</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/robust-measures-of-generalization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 15:33:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/robust-measures-of-generalization/</guid><description>&lt;p>These authors define &lt;em>robust error&lt;/em> as the least upper bound on the expected loss over a family of environmental settings (including dataset, model architecture, learning algorithm, etc.):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>\[\sup_{e\in\mathcal F}\mathbb E_{\omega\in P^e}\left[\ell(\phi,\omega)\right]\]&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that this is an &lt;strong>upper bound&lt;/strong> and not an average is very important and is what makes this work unique from previous work in this direction. Indeed, what we should be concerned about is not how poorly a model performs on the &lt;em>average&lt;/em> sample but on the &lt;em>worst-case&lt;/em> sample.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It's not just size that matters: small language models are also few-shot learners</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/not-just-size-that-matters/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 13:13:54 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/not-just-size-that-matters/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>We presented this paper as a mini-lecture in Bang Liu&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~liubang/IFT%206289%20-%20Winter%202022.htm">IFT6289&lt;/a> course in winter 2022.

The post contains no summarization, only questions and thoughts.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes these scaling laws can feel like pseudoscience because they&amp;rsquo;re a post hoc attempt to place a trend line on data. How can we be confident that the trends we observe actually reflect the scaling laws that we&amp;rsquo;re after? In the limitations section they mention that they didn&amp;rsquo;t tune hyperparameters for fine-tuning or for the code data distribution. How can we know that a confounding hyperparameter is not responsible for the trend we see?

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that in the results for NMT (Figure 1) we would expect the lines in the graph on the left to curve as the capacity of the individual models is exhausted. That&amp;rsquo;s why the authors fit the curves with an extra constant added. Meanwhile, the results in the graph on the right are curved because as the data size grows, the optimal model size also grows and it becomes increasingly difficult to find the right hyperparameters to train the model down to the optimal generalization error.

&lt;li>Decreasing the rate of exposure to common words improves the training speed and increases the model&amp;rsquo;s accuracy on infrequent words.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A new training target they call &amp;ldquo;negative sampling&amp;rdquo; improves the training speed and the model&amp;rsquo;s accuracy on frequent words.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The original Skip-gram model computed probabilities using a hierarchical softmax, which allowed the model to compute only &lt;code>\(O(\log_2(|V|))\)&lt;/code> probabilities when estimating the probability of a particular word, rather than &lt;code>\(O(|V|)\)&lt;/code>. Negative sampling, on the other hand, deals directly with the generated vector representations. The negative sampling loss function basically tries to maximize cosine similarity between the input representation of the input word with the output representation of the neighboring word, while decreasing cosine similarity between the input word and a few random vectors. They find that the required number of negative examples decreases as the dataset size increases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep learning</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/deep-learning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:11:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/deep-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This post was created as an assignment in Bang Liu&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~liubang/IFT%206289%20-%20Winter%202022.htm">IFT6289&lt;/a> course in winter 2022.

&lt;p>The authors use the example of distinguishing between a Samoyed and a white wolf to talk about the importance of learning to rely on very small variations while ignoring others.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Our main hypothesis is that deep learning succeeded in part because of a set of inductive biases, but that additional ones should be added in order to go from good in-distribution generalization in highly supervised learning tasks (or where strong and dense rewards are available), such as object recognition in images, to strong out-of-distribution generalization and transfer learning to new tasks with low sample complexity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SpanBERT: improving pre-training by representing and predicting spans</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/spanbert/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 16:08:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/spanbert/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://kylrth.com/paper/bert/">BERT&lt;/a> optimizes the Masked Language Model (MLM) objective by masking word pieces &lt;em>uniformly at random&lt;/em> in its training data and attempting to predict the masked values.

&lt;p>To predict each individual masked token, a two-layer feedforward network was provided with the boundary token representations plus the position embedding of the target token, and the output vector representation was used to predict the masked token and compute cross-entropy loss exactly as in standard MLM.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep contextualized word representations</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/deep-contextualized-word-representations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 12:01:43 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/deep-contextualized-word-representations/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is the original paper introducing Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo).&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Unlike most widely used word embeddings, ELMo word representations are functions of the entire input sentence.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s what makes ELMo great: they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em>contextualized&lt;/em> word representations, meaning that they can express multiple possible senses of the same word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specifically, ELMo representations are a learned linear combination of all layers of an LSTM encoding. The LSTM undergoes general semi-supervised pretraining, but the linear combination is learned &lt;em>specific to the task&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s been shown that initial layers in LSTM encoders are more representative of syntax, while later layers tend to represent semantics, so this linear combination is a key advantage that allows ELMo to improve accuracy on tasks ranging from POS tagging to question answering.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/overcoming-catastrophic-forgetting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 10:47:28 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/overcoming-catastrophic-forgetting/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the paper they use Bayes&amp;rsquo; rule to show that the contribution of the first of two tasks is contained in the posterior distribution of model parameters over the first dataset.

&lt;p>In this paper, they perform that estimation using a multivariate Gaussian distribution.

&lt;p>The main contribution of this paper is that they&amp;rsquo;ve found that models tend to transfer &lt;em>faster&lt;/em> to a new distribution when they learn the correct causal relationships, and when those relationships are &lt;em>sparsely represented&lt;/em>, meaning they are represented by relatively few nodes in the network.

In this paper they used some recently proven stuff from algorithmic information theory (AIT) to show that for neural networks the parameter-function map is biased toward functions with low Komolgorov complexity, meaning that simple functions are more likely to appear given random choice of parameters. Since real world problems are also biased toward simple functions, this could explain the generalization/memorization results found by &lt;a href="https://kylrth.com/paper/understanding-requires-rethinking-generalization/">Zhang &lt;em>et al&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A closer look at memorization in deep networks</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/closer-look-at-memorization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 11:52:35 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/closer-look-at-memorization/</guid><description>&lt;p>This paper builds on what we learned in &lt;a href="https://kylrth.com/paper/understanding-requires-rethinking-generalization/">&amp;ldquo;Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>One of the great things about this work is that their framework allows for all kinds of hyperparameters.

&lt;p>From this picture, I think the following things need explaining:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>embeddings&lt;/strong> these are learned embeddings that convert the input and output tokens to vectors of the model dimension. In this paper, they actually used the same weight matrix for input embedding, output embedding, and the final linear layer before the final softmax.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>positional encoding&lt;/strong>: since there&amp;rsquo;s no concept of a hidden state or convolution that encodes the order of the inputs, we have to add some information about the position of the tokens. They used a sinusoidal positional encoding that was a function of the position and the dimension. The wavelength for each dimension forms a geometric progression from &lt;code>\(2\pi\)&lt;/code> to 10000 times that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>the outputs are &amp;ldquo;shifted right&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>multi-head attention&lt;/strong>: see below for a description of multi-head attention. In the encoder-decoder attention layers, &lt;code>\(Q\)&lt;/code> comes from the previous masked attention layer and &lt;code>\(K\)&lt;/code> and &lt;code>\(V\)&lt;/code> come from the output of the encoder. Everywhere else uses self-attention, meaning that &lt;code>\(Q\)&lt;/code>, &lt;code>\(K\)&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>\(V\)&lt;/code> are all the same.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;em>masked&lt;/em> multi-head attention&lt;/strong>: in the self-attention layers in the decoder, we can&amp;rsquo;t allow positions to attend to positions ahead of themselves, so we set all right-connecting values in the input of the softmax (right after scaling; see the image below) to negative infinity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>feed-forward blocks&lt;/strong> these are two linear transformation with ReLU in between. The transformations are the same across each position, but they are different transformations from layer to layer, as you might expect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>add &amp;amp; norm&lt;/strong>: these are residual connections followed by layer normalization.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

It makes it possible to do well on sentence-level (NLI, question answering) and token-level tasks (NER, POS tagging). In a unidirectional model, the word &amp;ldquo;bank&amp;rdquo; in a sentence like &amp;ldquo;I made a bank deposit.&amp;rdquo; has only &amp;ldquo;I made a&amp;rdquo; as its context, keeping useful information from the model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another cool thing is masked language model training (MLM). They train the model by blanking certain words in the sentence and asking the model to guess the missing word.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compositional generalization by factorizing alignment and translation</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/factorizing-alignment-and-translation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 09:11:16 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/factorizing-alignment-and-translation/</guid><description>&lt;p>They had a biRNN with attention for alignment encoding, and then a single linear function of each one-hot encoded word for encoding that single word.

&lt;p>Chapter 2 provides a relatively clear overview of how chain and non-chain models work in Kaldi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In chapter 3 he tried using negative conditional entropy as the loss function for the unsupervised data, and it helped a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In chapter 4 Manohar uses [CTC loss]/paper/ctc/.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In chapter 5, he discusses ways to do semi-supervised model training. It&amp;rsquo;s nice when you have parallel data in different domains, because then you can do a student-teacher model. When there&amp;rsquo;s no parallel data, the best you can do is decode the unsupervised data with the seed model and use that to train the LF-MMI model (see section 5.2.1).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connectionist temporal classification: labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural networks</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/ctc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 09:14:59 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/ctc/</guid><description>&lt;p>RNNs generally require pre-segmented training data, but this avoids that need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, you have the RNN output probabilities for each label (or a blank) for every frame, and then you find the most likely path across that lattice of probabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The section explaining the loss function was kind of complicated. They used their forward-backward algorithm (sort of like Viterbi) to get the probability of all paths corresponding to the output that go through each symbol at each time, and then they differentiated that to get the derivatives with respect to the outputs. Then it was backpropagation as normal from that point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google's neural machine translation system: bridging the gap between human and machine translation</title><link>https://kylrth.com/paper/google-nmt-2016/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 08:22:30 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://kylrth.com/paper/google-nmt-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This model was superseded by &lt;a href="https://kylrth.com/paper/google-zero-shot/">this one&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

The decoder has an &lt;em>allophone layer&lt;/em>, followed by other dense trainable layers. The allophone layer is a single trainable dense layer, but was initialized by a bunch of linguists who sat down and described the phone sets belonging to each phoneme in each language present in the training set.
